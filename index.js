Load New Event Posts

Search Existing Based on Query

Add New Event Based on Form

Check to make sure there isn't any input that's been type while the client was loading

have PHP based search as a fallback if JS isn't working

Im going to add the category events, and thought that it might also make sense to add a state tag if it exists

should probably make a hash based on date location to check against for the purposes of avoiding duplication

make sure when posts are created that they are also published at some point
